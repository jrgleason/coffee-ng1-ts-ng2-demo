**Demo App for Upgrading CoffeeScript+NG1 to TypeScript+NG2**

This demo shows how to run a CoffeeScript+NG1 app along side an Typescript+NG2 app.

I made this because I had issues upgrading a legacy app at work.

I have left 3 seperate branches or steps.

1. App with just NG1
2. App with NG1 and NG2 side by side
3. App where NG2 Component is embedded in an NG1 Directive

Master is the same as Step 3
